                            to CU Denver to major in biology/chemistry for a year. However, I took a semster off in
                            order to figure out what I wanted to do. Then I stumble upon DU's coding boot camp which
                            already changed my life. I never knew how fun and aesthically pleasing coding can be. The
                            bootcamp really sparked this passion and love for coding. Personally, I have ADHD so I tend
                            to get bored of things quickly. But every time I code, it always bring me to a new
                            adventure. </p1>

                    <p2> My goal at the end of this boot camp is to find a long lasting career in the coding industry.
                        Like an art-style coding company pick me up to design aesthic website, logos, pictures, and etc.
